*    QmsGameState contains information about a saved or loaded game of *
*    QMineSweeper, so a game can be restored at a later date. It also  *
*    includes static methods for serializing a saved game state to a   *
*    file (via Xml), so the games can be quickly loaded in a           *
*    human readable form, rather than using a binary format            *
